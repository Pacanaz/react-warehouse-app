This project was bootstrapped with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Using Chakra UI template as well.

## Warehouse system 

It uses localStorage for database.

Routes made with react router 6.4.3 with the new way of adding routes (didn't use loaders and actions though.)

Forms made with react-hook-forms.

Charts in product detail page made with react-chart-js-2

State management done with Context API.

(obviously you can check it all in package.json, and the files I'm just trying to fill this readme section up :D )
